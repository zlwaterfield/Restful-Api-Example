# Api Example

This is a very simple example of a api using mongo, node and express. 

Live link of my working example can be found at 

 - base `http://wilted.me`
 - endpoints `ski_resorts`, `:region/ski_resorts`, `ski_resorts/:id`

Regions Supported 
 - `alberta`
 - `ontario`
 - `quebec`

*For security reasons `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` have been commented out.
